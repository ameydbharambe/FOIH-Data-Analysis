# FOIH-Data-Analysis
Internship work for the Friends of Indus Hospital. 
Found and cleaned a dataset (see donations.csv). Later used it to generate various visualizations for demographics and socioeconomic factors such as income or gender. I also used Interval Regression to analyze the relationship between the income and donation levels. More will be added soon
